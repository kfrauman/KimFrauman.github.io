         <p> A little back story on how Archer and Kehlani came to be my pets. Almost 3 years ago in September, I came home from work
		 and saw a baby kitten across the street from my house, I proceeded to call her over and realized she was declawed. She was 
		 super friendly, and when I opened my door to go inside, she darted in. As we didn't own any pets, we decided to keep her,
		 as we didn't want to send her back outside with no way to fend for herself. She has been with us ever since and we 
		 are so thankful for finding her. We have had Archer since December, and he was a wedding gift from a friend that is a breeder.
		 Having a puppy is a lot more challenging then having a cat, but we wouldn't have it any other way!
