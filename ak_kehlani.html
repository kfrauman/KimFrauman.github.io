      <p>Hey there, my name is Kehlani. I am suspected of being almost 4 years old accoording to the vet. 
	     When my humans took me in I was already declawed and so I don't play very much. 
		 I would much rather lay around and sleep, or get treats. I do love getting treats, 
		 my humans have taught me to jump for my treats, and I love that. I got a new brother recently 
		 and I am not a fan of him really, I would rather be left alone to sleep. Thankfully I still get plenty of attention, 
		 I love rolling over so I can get tummy rubs too.</p>
